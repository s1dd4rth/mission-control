# Product Mission

## Pitch
**Action Centre** is the central nervous system for Agent OS that helps **Developers** manage the complexity of autonomous development by providing **unified orchestration of projects, agents, and design systems**.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **The Creator**: A developer building multiple products simultaneously using Agent OS.

### User Personas
**The Product Guy/Gal** (25-45)
- **Role:** Full-stack Developer / Entrepreneur
- **Context:** Juggling strategy, design, and code across multiple potential products.
- **Pain Points:** Context switching, losing track of agent states, fragmented workflows.
- **Goals:** High-velocity shipping, widely "Impeccable" design quality, seamless agent collaboration.

## The Problem

### Fragmentation of Control
Managing autonomous agents, design systems (`design-os`), and product strategy (`mission.md`) via scattered CLI commands is inefficient and opaque. Users lack a single "pane of glass" to see the health and state of their Agent OS instance.

**Our Solution:** A unified web-based **Action Centre** (running on port 5401) that visualizes the entire ecosystem, allowing direct manipulation of agent capabilities and design standards.

## Differentiators

### "Impeccable" Native
Unlike generic admin dashboards, Action Centre is built with and for the **Impeccable Design System**, embodying the very aesthetics and quality standards it enforces. It is not just a tool; it is a reference implementation.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Project Dashboard:** Visual overview of all active projects, their "Mission" status, and current phase.
- **Agent Orchestration:** Interface to view, install, and configure Agent Capabilities (Skills, Tools).
- **Design System Bridge:** Direct access to Design OS status, Token management, and Audit reports.

### Advanced Features
- **Workflow Visualizer:** Real-time view of the "Master Workflow" progress (Strategy -> Design -> Build).
